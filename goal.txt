The goal of this model is to classify sequences of integers by predicting the sum of the sequence. Each input is a fixed-length sequence of integers (tokens), and the model outputs a single class corresponding to the sum of those integers. The model is trained on synthetic data where the target is always the sum of the input sequence.
